# CIFAR-10 Image Classification

This repository contains a project for image classification using the CIFAR-10 dataset. Two different models, ANN (Artificial Neural Network) and CNN (Convolutional Neural Network), are implemented for image classification tasks. Additionally, exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the CIFAR-10 dataset is performed to gain insights into the data.

## Files Overview

1. **Image_Classification_Using_2Models.ipynb:**
   - This Jupyter Notebook file includes the implementation of both ANN and CNN models for image classification using the CIFAR-10 dataset.
   - It also contains exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the characteristics of the dataset.
   - The models are trained on the training set and evaluated on the test set, with predictions made on sample images.

2. **Image_Classification_Using_CNN.ipynb:**
   - In this notebook, only the CNN model is utilized for image recognition.
   - Images are downloaded from external sources and provided as input to the trained CNN model for classification.

3. **Image_Classification_Using_ANN.ipynb:**
   - Here, only the ANN model is used for image recognition.
   - Similar to the CNN recognition notebook, images are downloaded and fed into the trained ANN model for classification.

4. **EDA_On_Cifar10_Dataset.ipynb:**
   - This notebook focuses solely on exploratory data analysis (EDA) of the CIFAR-10 dataset.
   - It provides insights into the distribution of classes, visualization of sample images, and statistical summaries of the dataset.

## Usage

1. Open the respective Jupyter Notebook files using Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab.
2. Follow the instructions provided within each notebook for running the code and executing the analyses.
3. Experiment with different hyperparameters, architectures, or data preprocessing techniques to optimize model performance.
4. For image recognition notebooks, download images from external sources and provide them as input to the models for classification.
